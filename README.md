# Python miniprojects
This is a collection of small projects I've made to learn some Python in my spare time.

- :heavy_check_mark: __Tic-tac-toe__ - a command line version of a well known minigame.

- :x: __Blackjack__ - a simplified, command line version of a well known card game played against a computer.

- :x: __Collatz conjecture checker__ - A Qt5 GUI for checking the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) on your favourite numbers.

Projects marked with :heavy_check_mark: are considered finished, while those with :x: are a work in progress.
